Petlyst is a senior-year project developed at Bilkent University (CTIS) that aims to simplify and modernize the interaction between pet owners and veterinarians. The platform offers core features such as appointment scheduling, digital health record tracking, and real-time video consultations. Additionally, we integrated a lightweight AI assistant powered by a Large Language Model to support users with basic guidance and reminders. Throughout the project, I took part in both the development and design processes, focusing on building a solution that is both functional and easy to use. Petlyst reflects our team’s effort to address a real-world need with accessible and thoughtful technology. The project was awarded 3rd place among all CTIS senior projects, recognizing its innovation and impact.
